KNOWN BUGS: (great place to keep these, I know)
===========
pwr3 (default comparator doesn't trigger)
todo: Look at matching/matching weapon
title = search destroy => uses match instead of =
title matches search and destroy => triggers AND...
title matchesd & => blanks and shows all instead of combo cards
oo-ta => nothing (in text and NL?), remove the -. Maybe actually search with and without the special chars?
cancels blaster pro => says NOT includes blaster pro
is clone / is a clone => is includes lone
type = character => type matches character BUT type eq character => type = character
