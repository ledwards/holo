grid view
- ERROR  Warning: Cannot update a component (`StackNavigator`) while rendering a different component
(`DecklistsScreenListView`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `DecklistsScreenListView`,
follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render
- Grid View: tap targets on sites are shifted left


TODO:
- make headers transparent (use import { useHeaderHeight } from '@react-navigation/elements';)

NEXT:
- show Qty on DecklistsGridView

- two-sided cards should flip on first click, collapse on second click
- EBO is fucked up in the grid view
- order the views correctly
- refactor everything to use cards/decklists contextx
- click an inactive card to make current active inactive
